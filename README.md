# COVID-19 Data Analysis using SQL
This repository contains a project that showcases exploratory data analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using SQL. The project was completed as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my skills in data analysis and SQL.

# Project Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in unprecedented ways, and this project aims to explore the impact of the pandemic on different countries and regions. The project uses a publicly available COVID-19 dataset, which includes data on cases, deaths, and vaccination rates. Microsoft SQL Server was used to query the dataset and generate insights.

# Technologies Used
The project was completed using the following technologies:

Microsoft SQL Server

# Project Structure
The project is organized into the following files and folders:

README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and its contents.
CovidDataAnalysis.sql: This SQL file contains the queries used to analyze the COVID-19 dataset.

# Results
The data analysis revealed several insights, including:

* Proportion of individuals impacted
* The country with the highest infection rate relative to its population
* Demonstrates the percentage of the population that has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine
* The impact of the pandemic varied widely across different regions and countries.
